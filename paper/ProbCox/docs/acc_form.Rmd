<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--
1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows:

- [ ] This is a checkbox

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows:

- [x] This is a checked checkbox

Note that current versions of RStudio for Mac (this will change with RStudio versions 1.3 and higher) will not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.

2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph.

3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document.

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.

## Abstract

**Publicly Available:**

The data that is publicly availbe was taken from R-Survival [@therneau_package_2015].
Colon are data on trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer,  [@laurie_surgical_1989]. Lung are data extracted from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group on mortality for advanced lung cancer [@loprinzi_prospective_1994].
NAFLD is a large population-based study investigating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [@allen_nonalcoholic_2018]. Heart investigates mortality in patients from the Stanford heart transplant program [@crowley_covariance_1977]

**Non-publicly available:**

The UK Biobank (UKB) [@sudlow_uk_2015] is a large-scale biomedical database established in 2006. The information collected on individuals includes questionnaires and face-to-face interviews (covering general medical factors, lifestyle, environmental factors, socioeconomics, etc.), physical measurements, blood and urine assays, prescriptions, and genotypes, as well as linkage to their hospital admission records. Further, detailed information, like wearable devices, precise dietary information, is available for smaller subsets. In total there are 502628 participants, recruited between 2006 and 2010. All participants were between 40-69 years of age at their recruitment date. We study the association of standard risk factors and comorbidities, taken from the electronic health records, with the occurrence of a myocardial infarction. For details of the analysis see section 4 of the paper.


## Availability

- [X] Partial Data **are** publicly available.
- [X] PArtial Data **cannot be made** publicly available.


### Publicly available data

- [X] Data are available online at: https://github.com/alexwjung/ProbCox

- [X] Data are available as part of the paperâ€™s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.
-->
The UK-Biobank (UKB) data contains sensible information on individuals and cannot be openly shared for privacy considerations.
However, researchers can apply for access to the UKB under:
https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/apply-for-access

The simulation study we present in the paper closely resembles the data structure encountered in electronic health records, similar to the data in the UKB, and can be used as a guidance.

Electronic health records and biobanks contain a vast array of information on individuals that open new possibilities to study disease and are therefore highly important in biomedical research. However, the wealth of information also makes it difficult to obfuscate data in such a way as to preserve important structures in the data.
This inevitably leads to issue for openly distributing the data.

# Part 2: Code

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the code. If necessary, more details can be provided in files that accompany the code.
-->
We provide a python package (probcox) for the model implemented. This is a scalable version of the standard Cox model fitted via stochastic variational inference. The code is written entirely in pytorch/pyro and numpy.
We provide an algorithm to efficiently simulate survival times with time-varying covariates that resemble disease association studies in electronic health records.
The original scripts for all the analyses are provided. Additionally, there are jupyter notebooks that can be run in google colab to readily replicate all of the results presented (except for the UKB as we cannot provide the data as mentioned above).

#### Libraries and dependencies used by the code

We use conda [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/] as a package manager and the full list of install packages can be found/replicated via [R environment](./docs/requirements_R.txt) and [Python environment](./docs/requirements_python.txt), respectively.

### Supporting system/hardware requirements (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: System/hardware requirements including operating system with version number, access to cluster, GPUs, etc.
